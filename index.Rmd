## Bio

Hi, I'm Shu Luan. Welcome to my website! I'm currently a ScM [Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) student at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/). In my undergraduate, I have been doing single cell transcriptomics research on Human Plasma Cell Maturation in [Dr. Greg Gibson's lab](https://ggibsongt.wixsite.com/gibsongatech) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). Now I hope to gain a deeper understanding of statistics at Johns Hopkins and explore topics associated with immunology and brain cancers.

Outside of academics, I like photography, traveling, cooking and bartending. I post some of my photos (include my foods and drinks) on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shu.luan_photo/).
